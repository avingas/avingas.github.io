**Christ is King** is a hand-painted 16×20" oil artwork that blends traditional Christian iconography with a dramatic, contemporary fine-art sensibility. Painted with rich oils on gallery-wrapped canvas, the piece features Christ on a stylized, gold-lined Byzantine cross, illuminated against a storm-laden sky shifting from deep blues to burning crimson.

At the base of Golgotha lies a symbolic skull and crossbones—an ancient Christian reference to Adam, mortality, and the triumph of the King over death. The result is a visually striking and deeply devotional artwork suited for prayer rooms, home altars, chapels, or collectors of sacred imagery.

Every brushstroke is hand-rendered with attention to anatomy, light, and texture, giving the painting an almost icon-like presence that commands space and reverence.

Perfect for:

-Christian art collectors

-Churches, chapels, and devotional spaces

-Homes seeking a bold statement of faith

-Gifts for clergy, worship leaders, or loved ones

-Fans of sacred art, iconography, and classical techniques

This is a **one-of-a-kind original**, not a print.
