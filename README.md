# Ant — Art site (Jekyll starter)

This starter is configured for GitHub Pages using Jekyll collections for artwork.
Folder structure highlights:

- _config.yml
- _layouts/default.html
- index.html
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/images/ (place your art here)
- _paintings/ (each painting as a markdown file with front matter)

To use:
1. Replace `url` in `_config.yml` with your GitHub Pages URL (or remove it for local build).
2. Add your painting images into `assets/images/` and update the `image:` path in each painting markdown file.
3. Commit and push to GitHub. In the repo settings -> Pages, enable Pages from `main` branch (root) if not already.
4. Jekyll will build and publish automatically for GitHub Pages.

This starter includes a sample painting and a mockup image used in the hero. Replace with your own.
